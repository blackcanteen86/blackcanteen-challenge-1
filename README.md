# Blackcanteen-Challenge-1
- Deployed Website: https://blackcanteen86.github.io/blackcanteen-challenge-1/

## Describtion:
I removed the div elements and replaced them with semantic elements in html and css. I made sure the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position. I added ALT attributes to the images. I gave a descriptive title. I used VS code and git bash to format the starter code and push the code to git hub. I made the website public by making it go live. I completed the  project alone and I used an MIT license.
